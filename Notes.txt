A JWT can be encrypted using either

  a.  A symmetric key (shared secret)
  b.  An asymmetric keys (the private key of a private-public pair).
      Recommended


^^^
Symmetric key:
The same key is used for both encryption (when the JWT is created)
and decryption (MobileTogether Server uses the key to verify the JWT).

The symmetric key—also known as the shared secret—is stored as
a setting in MobileTogether Server.

^^^
Asymmetric keys:
Different keys are used for encryption (private key)
and decryption (public key).

The public key is stored as a setting in MobileTogether Server
so that the JWT can be verified.
